# C - Bit manipulation

In this project, I learned how to manipulate bits and use the
bitwise operators `>>`, `<<`, `&`, `|`, and `^` in C.

## Tasks :

File 0-binary_to_uint.c C function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.

File 1-print_binary.c C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

File 2-get_bit.c C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

File 3-set_bit.c C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to `1`.

File 4-clear_bit.c C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to `0`.

File 5-flip_bits.c C function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.

File 100-get_endianness.c is a C function that checks the endianness.

File 101-password File containing the password for the program.

File main.h is the header file for all the function prototypes..
